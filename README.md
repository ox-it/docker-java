# Docker Oracle Java Image

This is a simple image that grabs a copy of the Oracle JDK and installs it
in /opt/jdk and sets up the links and JAVA_HOME. This image was created because
there wasn't a good image on the docker hub that had new versions and included
tags so that we could lock down to a specific version.
